# Skin_Cancer_Detection
This project is a Gradio-based web application for detecting Melanoma skin cancer from lesion images using a trained CNN model in TensorFlow. Users can upload an image, and the app classifies it as Benign or Malignant, along with a confidence score. It provides a fast, user-friendly interface for early skin cancer risk assessment.
