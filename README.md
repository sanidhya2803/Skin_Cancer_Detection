# Skin_Cancer_Detection
This project is a Gradio-based web application for detecting Melanoma skin cancer from lesion images using a trained CNN model in TensorFlow. Users can upload an image, and the app classifies it as Benign or Malignant, along with a confidence score. It provides a fast, user-friendly interface for early skin cancer risk assessment.

# ðŸ§ª Melanoma Skin Cancer Classifier

This is a deep learning-based web application that detects **Melanoma (skin cancer)** from images of skin lesions using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The app is built using **Gradio** and leverages **TensorFlow** for model inference.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload a skin lesion image
- Predict whether the lesion is **Benign** or **Malignant**
- Displays classification result and prediction confidence
- Simple, intuitive web interface using Gradio
